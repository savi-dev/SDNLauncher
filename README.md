SDN Launcher
===============

In this work, we will utilize the SAVI testbed alongside a software defined switch (OpenVSwitch) to dynamically create network topologies specified by the user. Similar to mininet, the users will be able to specify the number of hosts and switches and specify how they want them to be connected. 
The goal is to create a layer 2 or a layer 3 network and linking up the nodes as defined by the user topology. For this purpose, we use SAVI TB and VXLAN tunneling protocol to create arbitrary overlay networks. 
These overlay networks could be used in variety of applications from deploying a large scale OpenFlow network in order to test a SDN controller and application to running a large scale distributed application on a desired topology.
